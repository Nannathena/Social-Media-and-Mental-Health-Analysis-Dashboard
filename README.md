📌 Project Overview
This project explores the complex relationship between social media usage and mental well-being. Using a dataset of 500 respondents (Average Age: ~33), I developed an interactive Power BI dashboard to visualize how different platforms and daily screen time influence stress levels, sleep quality, and overall happiness.

Key Insights & Findings

1. The "Instagram Paradox"
One of the most striking findings in this analysis is the behavior of Instagram users compared to other platforms:
* High Intensity, Low Satisfaction: Although Instagram has the lowest user count in this sample (74 respondents), it records the Highest Daily Screen Time.
* Mental Health Impact: Heavy Instagram usage correlates with negative outcomes. It has the Highest Average Stress Level (6.96/10) and the Lowest Happiness Index (7.99/10) compared to all other platforms.

2. The "X" (Twitter) Anomaly
Contradicting the common perception of toxicity on text-based platforms, respondents who primarily use X (Twitter) reported the Highest Happiness Index (8.65) and the Lowest Stress Levels (6.45). This suggests that platform format (visuals vs. text) might impact user well-being differently.

3. Correlation Analysis (Screen Time vs. Well-being)
The correlation analysis reveals a statistically significant relationship between screen time and health metrics:
* Sleep Quality: There is a strong negative correlation between screen time and sleep. As daily screen time exceeds 5 hours, sleep quality drops sharply below the average of 6.30.
* Stress Levels: A clear linear positive correlation exists—as screen time increases, reported stress levels rise proportionally.

4. Demographic Balance
The survey data is well-balanced between genders (49.6% Male, 45.8% Female), ensuring that the insights are not heavily skewed by gender bias.

Technical Process:
* Data Cleaning: Processed raw data to ensure consistency in categorical variables (Gender, Platform).
* Data Modeling: Created relationships between demographic tables and health metric tables.
* Visualization:
    * Used Scatter Plots with trend lines to visualize correlations.
    * Implemented Dynamic Slicers for Age, Gender, and Platform filtering.
    * Designed a clean UI with clear KPI Cards for immediate insights.

Conclusion:
The data suggests a "Digital Detox" might be necessary for heavy users. Platforms that demand high visual attention and longer screen time (like Instagram) appear to be more taxing on mental health compared to platforms with lower screen time requirements (like LinkedIn) or text-based interactions (like X).
